Templatebread theme created by Haxzamatic. 

This is a template for the T-Mobile Theme Engine. It has all AOSP graphics, so nothing is themed. 

Hope this helps some people with making themes, I have tons of graphics still to add. I figured till I get the xml's are finished I would share what I have and push the updates here. 
All of the png's I added have the app com name in the begining of the png name. so if the png is from the launcher it would be com_android_launcher_pngname.png.  

Now go have some fun :)
